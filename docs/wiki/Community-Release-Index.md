# Community Release Index

This index summarizes public CAVRA Community release records, release notes,
verification packets, publication state, and next action. It is the public
starting point for users and maintainers who need to verify which Community
artifacts are published and which release evidence is still a dry run.

## Release Summary

| Release | State | GitHub Release | Release Notes | Verification Packet | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Community GA v0.1.0 | Published | <https://github.com/Huzefaaa2/cavra/releases/tag/community-v0.1.0> | `docs/releases/community-v0.1.0.md` | `docs/release-verifications/community-v0.1.0-post-release-verification.md` | Use as the current public Community GA baseline. |
| Community v0.1.1 | Dry run | <https://github.com/Huzefaaa2/cavra/releases/tag/community-v0.1.1> | `docs/releases/community-v0.1.1.md` | `docs/release-verifications/community-v0.1.1-maintenance-verification.md` | Publish only after real v0.1.1 artifacts exist and verification warnings are replaced with passing evidence. |

## Verification Controls

Public Community releases are checked by:

- `scripts/validate-release-packets.py`
- `scripts/validate-maintenance-release-evidence.py`
- `scripts/validate-community-release-note-freshness.py`
- `scripts/validate-community-release-index.py`
- `scripts/validate-boundaries.sh`
- `.github/workflows/verify-community-release.yml`

## Next Recommendation

Harden the Go enforcement plane production path for Unix-socket/gRPC interface completion, air-gapped packaging, reproducibility, upgrade validation, performance, and operational readiness evidence.
