# Phase Completion Log

## Phase 1: Productization Foundation

Status: complete.

Completed:
- CAVRA identity and README.
- Python package rename to `cavra`.
- CLI command `cavra`.
- MCP command `cavra-mcp-server`.
- Claude Code setup command `cavra init claude-code`.
- Runtime decisions for file, command, Git, MCP, and PR attestation.
- Regulated policy packs.
- FastAPI app contract.
- Before the Agent Acts sandbox.
- Docker image and Compose validation.
- Enterprise docs and wiki-ready pages.

Validation:
- `python3 -m pytest -q` passed.
- Docker image build passed.
- Docker CLI and MCP commands passed.
- Docker Compose API and sandbox startup passed.
- Brand validation passed.

## Next Phase

Phase 2: Policy Engine Hardening.

Status: complete.

Completed:
- Strict JSON Schema validation for CAVRA policy packs.
- Policy inheritance through `metadata.inherits`.
- Normalized compiled policy output.
- Semantic policy diff output.
- Policy signature metadata.
- Policy verification with tamper detection.
- Tests for validation, inheritance, diff, and signatures.

## Next Phase

Phase 3: Evidence Hub and Attestation.

Status: in progress.

Completed:
- Evidence bundle manifest generation.
- Bundle checksums.
- Optional HMAC manifest signature.
- PR attestation output.
- Compliance mapping output.
- SIEM event output.
- Evidence verification command.
- Splunk HEC, Microsoft Sentinel, Datadog, and generic webhook SIEM export payloads.
- S3 Object Lock and Azure immutable blob immutable storage reference plans.

Recommended next issue: evidence retention policy controls and API persistence for evidence metadata.

## Transparent Agent Methodology Enablement

Status: complete.

Completed:
- Declarative CAVRA agent manifests for product, architect, backend, frontend, test, security, docs, reviewer, and release roles.
- Agent task issue template and agent label catalog.
- Conservative GitHub Actions orchestrator scaffold that validates transparent agent manifests.
- `cavra-agentic-delivery` policy pack for bot identity, branch naming, PR attestation, approvals, and documentation requirements.
- Transparent agent methodology docs, orchestration architecture docs, wiki pages, and SVG diagram.

Recommended next issue: implement the real GitHub App orchestrator backend only after protected branch checks, evidence verification, and human approval requirements are enforced.
