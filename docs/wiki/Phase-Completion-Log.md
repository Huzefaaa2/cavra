# Phase Completion Log

## Phase 1: Productization Foundation

Status: complete.

Completed:
- CAVRA identity and README.
- Python package rename to `cavra`.
- CLI command `cavra`.
- MCP command `cavra-mcp-server`.
- Claude Code setup command `cavra init claude-code`.
- Runtime decisions for file, command, Git, MCP, and PR attestation.
- Regulated policy packs.
- FastAPI app contract.
- Before the Agent Acts sandbox.
- Docker image and Compose validation.
- Enterprise docs and wiki-ready pages.

Validation:
- `python3 -m pytest -q` passed.
- Docker image build passed.
- Docker CLI and MCP commands passed.
- Docker Compose API and sandbox startup passed.
- Brand validation passed.

## Next Phase

Phase 2: Policy Engine Hardening.

Status: complete.

Completed:
- Strict JSON Schema validation for CAVRA policy packs.
- Policy inheritance through `metadata.inherits`.
- Normalized compiled policy output.
- Semantic policy diff output.
- Policy signature metadata.
- Policy verification with tamper detection.
- Tests for validation, inheritance, diff, and signatures.

## Next Phase

Phase 3: Evidence Hub and Attestation.

Status: in progress.

Completed:
- Evidence bundle manifest generation.
- Bundle checksums.
- Optional HMAC manifest signature.
- PR attestation output.
- Compliance mapping output.
- SIEM event output.
- Evidence verification command.
- Splunk HEC, Microsoft Sentinel, Datadog, and generic webhook SIEM export payloads.
- S3 Object Lock and Azure immutable blob immutable storage reference plans.
- Ed25519 evidence manifest signatures and key generation.
- Evidence retention policy artifacts and minimum-retention verification.
- Evidence metadata indexing and API persistence.
- More elaborate C4 container diagram for enterprise architecture review.
- Evidence key IDs, trust-root verification, and rotation guidance.
- SQLite-backed evidence metadata search with filters and pagination.
- PR attestation verification reports.
- Hosted evidence console views for search and PR attestation verification.
- Initial SQLite migration for evidence metadata.
- Console API wiring for same-origin and cross-origin deployments.
- JSON and SQLite evidence search filter/pagination parity.
- Idempotent SQLite migration automation with `cavra evidence migrate`.
- Trust-root bundle generation and enterprise distribution guidance.

Recommended next issue: continue Phase 4 Approval Router with console break-glass creation and approval audit detail views. Keep a narrow Phase 3 follow-up for hosted attestation artifact downloads backed by governed object storage.

## Phase 4: Approval Router

Status: in progress.

Completed:
- Approval request model and JSON persistence.
- API approval queue with list, create, fetch, approve, deny, expire, attach-decision, and break-glass endpoints.
- CLI approval queue with create, list, approve, deny, expire, and break-glass commands.
- Mandatory reason, actor, approver group, expiry, and optional external reference for break-glass overrides.
- Approval outcome linkage into evidence metadata and PR attestations.
- Default approver group routing policies.
- SQLite approval persistence and migration.
- Slack, Teams, Jira, ServiceNow, and webhook reference payload exports.
- Console approval queue view.
- Repository-specific JSON/YAML routing configuration.
- Claims-based approval authorization for local OIDC-style actor claims.
- Signed OIDC/JWKS token validation with issuer, audience, expiry, and not-before checks.
- Repository RBAC policy files with group mappings and repository-scoped approval permissions.
- Credential-free Slack, Teams, Jira, ServiceNow, and webhook request specs.
- Secret-backed live provider delivery with retry, timeout, and redacted delivery evidence.
- Console approval actions for approve, deny, and expire.

Recommended next issue: add console break-glass creation, approval audit detail views, and hosted attestation artifact retrieval.

## Transparent Agent Methodology Enablement

Status: complete.

Completed:
- Declarative CAVRA agent manifests for product, architect, backend, frontend, test, security, docs, reviewer, and release roles.
- Agent task issue template and agent label catalog.
- Conservative GitHub Actions orchestrator scaffold that validates transparent agent manifests.
- `cavra-agentic-delivery` policy pack for bot identity, branch naming, PR attestation, approvals, and documentation requirements.
- Transparent agent methodology docs, orchestration architecture docs, wiki pages, and SVG diagram.

Recommended next issue: implement the real GitHub App orchestrator backend only after protected branch checks, evidence verification, and human approval requirements are enforced.
